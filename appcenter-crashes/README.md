# AppCenter SDK for React Native
## AppCenter Crashes Module

App Center is your continuous integration, delivery and learning solution for iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS apps. Get faster release cycles, higher-quality apps, and the insights to build what users want.

AppCenter Crashes will automatically generate a crash log every time your app crashes. The log is first written to the device's storage and when the user starts the app again, the crash report will be sent to AppCenter. Collecting crashes works for both beta and live apps, i.e. those submitted to the App Store. Crash logs contain valuable information for you to help fix the crash.
