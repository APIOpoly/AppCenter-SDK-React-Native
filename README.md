# react-native-sonoma-private

Development repository for the Sonoma SDK for React Native.

## Getting Started (iOS)

1. Clone the repository
2. Build native SDK dependencies
  - Open up `AvalancheSDK.xcworkspace` from Sonoma-SDK-iOS submodule directory
  - Select "AllDoc + Frameworks" target and build
3. Build Demo app
  - `cd` into SonomaDemoApp folder and `npm install`
  - `cd` into ios folder and `pod install`. If you have not installed CocoaPods, `sudo gem install cocoapods`.
  - If you make changes in any of the individual SDKs (eg. RNSonomaHub, RNSonomaErrorReporting), you will need to run the above two steps again to test your changes using the sample app.
4. Configure Demo app
  - Modify `SonomaDemoApp/ios/SonomaDemoApp/AppDelegate.m` to use your Sonoma App ID in the call to `[AVAAvalanche start: withFeatures:]`.
5. Run Demo app
  - `cd` into SonomaDemoApp folder and `npm start`
  - Open up `SonomaDemoApp/ios/SonomaDemoApp.xcworkspace`, select desired simulator and click the "Run" button

## Getting Started (Android)

1. Clone the repository
2. Build Demo app
  - `cd` into SonomaDemoApp folder and `npm install`
  - If you make changes in any of the individual SDKs (eg. RNSonomaHub, RNSonomaErrorReporting), you will need to `npm install` again to test your changes using the sample app.
3. Configure Demo app
  - Modify `SonomaDemoApp/android/app/src/main/java/com/sonomademoapp/MainApplication.java` to use your Sonoma App ID in the call to `Sonoma.start(...)`.
4. Run Demo app
  - Boot up Android emulator
  - `cd` into SonomaDemoApp folder and `react-native run-android`

## To-do items:

### iOS

1. Error Reporting
  - Wait for notification from JS before sending crash
  - Send special JS error report if exception is from JS
  - Get last session crash details from JS
  - Implement "automatic" crash sending / set custom crash listener from JS
  - Send crash with text attachment
  - Send crash with binary attachment

### Android

1. Error Reporting
  - Send special JS error report if exception is from JS
  - Implement "automatic" crash sending / set custom crash listener from JS
  - Send crash with binary attachment

### JS

1. Error Reporting
  - Add global exception handler to capture JS unhandled exceptions send to server
2. Analytics
  - Figure out how auto page tracking should work for React Native
3. Type definitions (useful for VS Code IntelliSense)
4. Write tests
