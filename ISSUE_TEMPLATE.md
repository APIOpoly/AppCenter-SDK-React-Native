Thanks for your interest in using the App Center SDK for React Native.

If your issue is not about the Analytics/Crashes/Push SDK for React Native,
(for example a build issue and you are not using our SDK, or your issue is about CodePush),
then please create the ticket on Intercom instead (using the blue chat button on any https://appcenter.ms page).

Please mention your react-native version, cocoapods version,
and the list of 3rd party libraries you are using if having build or link issues.
