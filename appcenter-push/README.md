## AppCenter Push Module

AppCenter is mission control for mobile apps. Get faster release cycles, higher-quality apps, and the insights to build what users want.

AppCenter Push enables you to send push notifications to users of your app from the AppCenter portal. We use APNs for iOS apps and FCM for Android. You can also segment your user base based on a set of properties and send them targeted notifications.
